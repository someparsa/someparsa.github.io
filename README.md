Hello and welcome to my website. Here I post brief information about myself.

I am Parsa Yazdi, a structural engineer and a hobyist software developer. I have a few years of experience in structural engineering design, automation and field-work. In the recent years I am focused on developing pieces of codes, spreadsheets and software to automate engineering procedures, using API's and programming mainly in Python. I have experience in other languages as well. Not a git and linux geek, but coding is my hobby!

My PhD research focuses on optimization, automation and applications of the AI.

You can GMail me using my name and family name in this format: **parsa (dot) yazdi**. I am not interested in other pieces of software for communication. I am usually fast in responding my emails! If you are not happy with sending emails, I like to have face to face sessions too. I am crazy about coffee! Apparently I don't like to be a full I/O person!

Handle for my Github and Twitter accounts is **someparsa**; however I do not Tweet so often! You may use **parsayazdi** to find me on LinkedIn. I love professional connections and I occasionally write there.

If you like to play chess too, let's play on Lichess; my username is **parsayazdi**. Not a chess addict but I love this game and it is my hobby. You will be the winner, I guess!
