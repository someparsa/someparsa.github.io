Hello and Welcome to my website. Here I post brief information about myself, the links that I like to share with my audience and the content that I want them to read.

## About me

I am Parsa Yazdi, a structural engineer and a software developer. I have a few years of experience in structural engineering analysis, design and automation. In the recent years I am mainly focused on developing pieces of codes, spreadsheets and software to automate engineering procedures. This includes codes and api's in Python, C#, etc.
