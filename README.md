Hello and Welcome to my website. Here I post brief information about myself.

## About me

I am Parsa Yazdi, a structural engineer and a hobyist software developer. I have a few years of experience in structural engineering design, automation and field-work. In the recent years I am focused on developing pieces of codes, spreadsheets and software to automate engineering procedures, using API's and programming mainly in Python. I have experience in other languages as well. Not a git and linux geek, but code is my hobby!

Moreover, it is a while I am focusing on discentralized smart contracts, solidity and web3. It is a world and I am still in my weak steps to get in the field.

## Contact Information

You can GMail me using my name and family name in this format: **parsa (dot) yazdi**. I am not interested in other pieces of software for communication. Contact me anytime at your preference, I will be happy to answer. I am usually fast in responding my emails! If you are not happy with sending emails, I like to have face to face sessions too. I am crazy about coffee! Apparently I don't like to be a full I/O person!

Handle for my Github and Twitter accounts is **someparsa**; however I do not Tweet so often! You may use **parsayazdi** to find me on LinkedIn. I love professional connections and I occasionally write there.

If you like to play chess too, let's play on Lichess; my username is **parsayazdi**. Not a chess addict but I love this game and it is my hobby. You will be the winner, I guess!
